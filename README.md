Solving PageRank Algorithm Using Hadoop 

Questions: Using the introduced dataset, which contains 10 tomans of each document, obtain the following items

## Question 1

Get the count of each word and report the 10 most frequent words

## Question 2

For each word, calculate the value of inverse document frequency or IDF using Partitionioner

## Question 3

Calculate the probability of simultaneous occurrence of two tokens in one node using IN-Mapper Combiner

## Question 4

Considering that the words inside a document are usually related to each other, consider a two-way relationship between the 10 words of each document, i.e. suppose each of the tokens in the document has a link to the other tokens of that document and is ranked using the Page Rank algorithm. Count each word and report the 10 highest related words
